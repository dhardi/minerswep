## How To Play

 The game starts with a board with 8 columns and 8 rows. 4 bombs are planted randomly across the board and your duty is to guess where it will be safe to step with eight attempts. If you step on a bomb you lose.

## Testing 

During my project I set the objective of making a pokemon game with a first generation of 150 pokemons. The first challenge was to create a system that would generate a random value for each attribute and assign it to all 150 pokemons.
After this challenge, the gameplay would come, so I created a number comparison system that in the end would compare the highest value of the attribute. To test the gameplay, I had my eight-year-old son play and explore the game.I also put my wife to play and it was vitally important for someone who is not familiar with games. 
The game will guide you how to play, for players who still have questions about how to play, I have implemented a how to play section.
I had a lot of problems with the game mechanics when adding events and how to compare the selected object. These problems helped me learn how the event click system works best and the type of variable we should use, but the biggest challenge was making the CPU selects a random card and a random attribute value without repeating for the entire cycle after that the array system was absorbed by me.
